## Extension Settings

|Setting|Type|Description|
|-------|----------|--------|
|`hoi4ModUtilities.installPath`|`string`|Hearts of Iron IV install path. Without this all icons will be invisible.|
|`hoi4ModUtilities.loadDlcContents`|`boolean`|Whether to load DLC images when previewing files. Enabling this will use more memory (All DLCs are around 600MB).|

## Known Issues

* DDS preview supports RGB or RGBA format only. Most of DDS files in Heart of Iron IV are in this format. DDS files in other format can't be previewed yet.
* Focus tree preview uses sprites from `interface/goals.gfx`. If you defined custom sprite and use it in focus, it will be shown as unknown focus icon.
